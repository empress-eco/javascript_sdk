## About The Project

### üìñ Overview

JavaScript SDK is a TypeScript/JavaScript library that bridges the gap between developers and the Framework backend. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing database operations, handling file uploads, making API calls, and performing user authentication.

### üåü Key Features

- üîê **Authentication**: Supports both cookie-based and token-based authentication.
- üóÑ **Database**: Easily manage your documents - Get, update, create, delete, fetch lists and counts.
- üìÑ **File Upload**: A straightforward file upload function.
- ü§ôüèª **API Calls**: API calls made easy.

The library uses [Axios](https://axios-http.com) under the hood to make API calls to your backend, ensuring performance and reliability.

## Technical Stack and Setup Instructions

JavaScript SDK utilizes modern technologies like TypeScript and Axios. To get started, you need to have either npm or yarn installed on your system. 

### Installation

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/empress-eco/javascript_sdk.git
```

Install the JavaScript SDK library using npm:

```bash
npm install Empress-js-sdk
```

or yarn:

```bash
yarn add Empress-js-sdk
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can initialize the library as follows:

```js
import { EmpressApp } from 'Empress-js-sdk';
// Add your backend's URL
const Empress = new EmpressApp('https://test.Empress.cloud');
```

For token-based authentication (OAuth bearer tokens or API key/secret pairs), initialize the library like this:

```js
import { EmpressApp } from "Empress-js-sdk";

const Empress = new EmpressApp("https://test.Empress.cloud", {
    useToken: true,
    // Pass a custom function that returns the token as a string
    token: getTokenFromLocalStorage(),
    // This can be "Bearer" or "token"
    type: "Bearer"
})
```

The library offers numerous functions for database operations, user authentication, API calls, and file uploads. Refer to the [official documentation](https://grow.empress.eco/) for detailed instructions.
